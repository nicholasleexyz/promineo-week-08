### 2. What are SaSS and LESS?

SaSS - A CSS pre-processor and a DSL(Domain Specific Language) originally written in ruby that compiles to CSS in an attempt to be more expressive and scalable over writing vanilla CSS files. Examples of SaSS features are nesting selectors and declaring variables.

LESS - Another CSS pre-processor written in javascript that has similar features to SaSS.

### 3. What is a highlight of what you have learned this week? 

    CSS selectors with keywords "even" and "odd".
